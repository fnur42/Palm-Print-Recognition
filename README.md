In this study, a method is proposed using various image processing and machine learning techniques to solve the palm print recognition problem.

After feature extraction was performed with techniques such as Gaussian Low-pass filtering, Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) and Gabor filtering, image segmentation was performed with Otsu Thresholding and k-means segmentation and high accuracy rates were achieved by feeding the extracted features to the CNN model.
